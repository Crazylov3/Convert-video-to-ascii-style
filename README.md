# Convert-video-to-ascii-style
Require :
      moviepy~=1.0.3
      Pillow~=8.2.0
      pygame~=2.0.1
      opencv-python~=4.5.3.56
      
1.Put your video to input_video folder, or you can run get_video_from_yt.py to download a video from youtbe by a url. Your video must end with one of these : mkv, mp4, flv, avi, wmv

2.Run main.py and wait. The programe will save ascii style image out to folder, reload it and convert these image to video so as not to consume too much system resources, this will take a while. So, I recommend using short videos.
